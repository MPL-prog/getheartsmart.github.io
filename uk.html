    <h1>United Kingdom: Emergency guidance</h1>
    <p>If you or someone else may be having a heart attack in the UK, act quickly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Call 999</strong> immediately and ask for an ambulance. Do not drive yourself or the person to hospital.</li>
      <li>Keep the person calm and seated comfortably. Loosen any tight clothing and reassure them help is on the way.</li>
      <li>The emergency operator may advise giving one adult‑dose aspirin (300&nbsp;mg) to chew. Only do this if the person is 16 or older, not allergic to aspirin and has no history of bleeding problems. Do <em>not</em> give aspirin if they are taking anticoagulants or have been told not to take it.</li>
      <li>If the person has prescribed angina medication (such as glyceryl trinitrate spray), assist them in using it.</li>
      <li>Stay with the person. If they become unresponsive and are not breathing normally, begin CPR and use an AED if one is available.</li>
    </ul>
