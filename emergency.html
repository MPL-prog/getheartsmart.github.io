      <p>If you suspect a heart attack, call your local emergency number immediately. The steps below are general guidance for major regions. Always follow the instructions of the emergency operator.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="uk-title">
      <h2 id="uk-title">United Kingdom</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Call 999</strong> right away and ask for an ambulance.</li>
        <li>Stay calm and reassure the person. Encourage them to rest in a comfortable seated position.</li>
        <li>Follow the operator’s instructions. They may advise giving a 300&nbsp;mg aspirin tablet to chew if the person is 16 or older, not allergic and has no history of bleeding issues. <em>Do not</em> give aspirin if they are taking anticoagulants or have been told not to take it.</li>
        <li>If the person has prescribed angina medication (such as glyceryl trinitrate spray), assist them in taking it.</li>
        <li>Monitor breathing and responsiveness. If they become unresponsive and are not breathing normally, begin CPR and use an automated external defibrillator (AED) if available.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="us-title" class="alt">
      <h2 id="us-title">United States &amp; Canada</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Call 911</strong> immediately. Tell the dispatcher you suspect a heart attack and follow their instructions.</li>
        <li>Have the person stop activity and rest in a comfortable position.</li>
        <li>If they are conscious, able to chew or swallow and have no known allergy or contraindication to aspirin, assist them to take <strong>one uncoated adult aspirin (325&nbsp;mg) or two to four low‑dose tablets (81&nbsp;mg)</strong>. Do not delay calling 911 to search for aspirin.</li>
        <li>Do not offer aspirin to anyone under 18 or to those taking blood thinners unless a healthcare professional or dispatcher specifically advises it.</li>
        <li>Never drive the person to the hospital yourself. Ambulances can start treatment en route.</li>
        <li>Remain with the person. If they become unresponsive and are not breathing normally, begin CPR and use an AED if available.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="eu-title">
      <h2 id="eu-title">European Union</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Call 112</strong> immediately. Explain what is happening and provide your location. Follow the dispatcher’s instructions.</li>
        <li>Keep the person calm and seated comfortably. Encourage them to loosen tight clothing.</li>
        <li>The dispatcher may advise giving an adult dose of aspirin (typically 300&nbsp;mg) if the person is not allergic and has no contraindications. Only administer medication if specifically instructed.</li>
        <li>If the person has prescribed angina medication such as glyceryl trinitrate spray, assist them in taking it.</li>
        <li>Stay with the person until help arrives. If they become unresponsive and stop breathing normally, begin CPR and use an AED if available.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="note-title">Note on Aspirin Use</h2>
      <p>Giving aspirin can reduce blood clotting, but there are risks. Only assist someone to take aspirin if they can chew and swallow and you are sure they are not allergic, have no history of bleeding disorders or are not taking anticoagulant medication. When in doubt, wait for emergency operators to advise.</p>
