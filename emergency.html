    <h1>In an Emergency</h1>
    <p>If you suspect a heart attack, take immediate action. Call the emergency number for your region and follow the steps below. The information on this page is educational and does not replace professional medical advice.</p>

    <h2 id="uk">United Kingdom</h2>
    <p>Call <strong>999</strong> right away and ask for an ambulance. According to public first‑aid guidance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay calm and reassure the person. Encourage them to rest in a comfortable seated position.</li>
      <li>Follow the operator’s instructions. They may advise giving a 300&nbsp;mg adult aspirin tablet to chew if the person is 16 or older, is not allergic and has no history of bleeding issues. Do <em>not</em> give aspirin if the person has been told not to take it.</li>
      <li>If they have prescribed angina medication (such as glyceryl trinitrate spray), assist them in taking it.</li>
      <li>Monitor their breathing and responsiveness. If they become unresponsive and are not breathing normally, start CPR and use an automated external defibrillator (AED) if available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="us">United States &amp; Canada</h2>
    <p>Call <strong>911</strong> immediately for an ambulance. The American Red Cross advises:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have the person stop activity and rest in a comfortable position while you call for help.</li>
      <li>If they are awake, able to chew or swallow and allowed to have aspirin, you may assist them to take <strong>one regular (325&nbsp;mg) aspirin</strong> or <strong>two to four low‑dose (81&nbsp;mg) tablets</strong>. Check that they are not allergic and have no contraindications.</li>
      <li>Do not delay calling 911 to search for aspirin. Stay with the person until emergency medical services arrive.</li>
      <li>Never drive the person to the hospital yourself. Ambulance crews can begin treatment en route.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to provide CPR if they become unresponsive and are not breathing normally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="eu">European Union</h2>
    <p>Call <strong>112</strong> immediately and explain that you suspect a heart attack. Guidance may vary by country; always follow the advice of the emergency operator or your local health authority. In general: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage the person to rest and loosen any tight clothing.</li>
      <li>The operator may advise giving an adult dose of aspirin if the person is not allergic. Only administer medication under guidance.</li>
      <li>Monitor their condition and be ready to start CPR if they become unresponsive and are not breathing.</li>
    </ul>
