      <h1 id="learn-title">Learn about heart attacks and heart health</h1>
      <p>Understanding what happens during a heart attack and recognising the warning signs helps you respond quickly and reduces anxiety. The sections below provide concise, plain‑language explanations. For more detailed information, talk to a healthcare professional.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="what-title">
      <h2 id="what-title">What is a heart attack?</h2>
      <p>A heart attack occurs when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, usually by a clot in a coronary artery. Without oxygen, the affected part of the heart can be damaged or die. Symptoms vary and may be mild, so act quickly if you suspect one.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="symptoms-title">
      <h2 id="symptoms-title">Warning signs &amp; symptoms</h2>
      <p>Heart attack symptoms can present differently for each person. Common signs include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Pressure, heaviness or squeezing in the chest that may spread to the arms, neck, jaw, back or abdomen.</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath, either with or without chest discomfort.</li>
        <li>Nausea, vomiting or indigestion‑like discomfort.</li>
        <li>Feeling light‑headed, dizzy or unusually fatigued.</li>
        <li>Cold sweat or clammy skin.</li>
        <li>An overwhelming sense of anxiety or impending doom.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Symptoms can vary from person to person. Women, older adults and people with diabetes may experience unusual symptoms such as fatigue, back pain or shortness of breath without chest pain.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="difference-title">
      <h2 id="difference-title">Heart attack vs. cardiac arrest</h2>
      <p>A heart attack is a circulation problem caused by blocked blood flow to the heart muscle. The heart usually continues to beat. Cardiac arrest is an electrical problem: the heart suddenly stops beating effectively, causing the person to collapse and stop breathing. Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency requiring immediate CPR and defibrillation.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="risk-title">
      <h2 id="risk-title">Risk factors and prevention</h2>
      <p>Factors that increase heart attack risk include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise, a diet high in saturated fat, and family history of heart disease. You can reduce risk by:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Eating a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean proteins.</li>
        <li>Being physically active for at least 150 minutes per week.</li>
        <li>Not smoking and avoiding exposure to second‑hand smoke.</li>
        <li>Managing chronic conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes with the help of your doctor.</li>
        <li>Maintaining a healthy weight and limiting alcohol consumption.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="container" aria-labelledby="doctor-title">
      <h2 id="doctor-title">When to seek medical advice</h2>
      <p>If you experience persistent chest discomfort or any of the symptoms listed above, call your local emergency number immediately. Do not wait to see if symptoms go away. If you are at higher risk of heart disease, discuss regular check‑ups and risk reduction with your healthcare provider.</p>
