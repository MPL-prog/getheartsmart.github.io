      <h2>What is a heart attack?</h2>
      <p>A heart attack (medical term: myocardial infarction) happens when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot forming in a coronary artery. Without oxygen, the affected part of the heart can be damaged or die. Symptoms vary and may not always be severe, so it is important to act quickly if you suspect one.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="symptoms">
      <h2>Warning signs &amp; symptoms</h2>
      <p>The most common symptom is chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest. Pain may spread to your arms (usually the left arm but sometimes both arms), jaw, neck, back or abdomen. Other possible symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Feeling light‑headed or dizzy</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Sweating</li>
        <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
        <li>An overwhelming sense of anxiety</li>
        <li>Coughing or wheezing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have minor chest discomfort similar to indigestion, or no chest pain at all. Women, older adults and people with diabetes are more likely to experience atypical symptoms such as fatigue, back or jaw pain or shortness of breath without chest pain. If you think someone is having a heart attack, call the emergency number for your region immediately.</p>

    <section id="difference">
      <h2>Heart attack vs cardiac arrest</h2>
      <p>Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, a heart attack and cardiac arrest are different events. A heart attack is a circulation problem – blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked but the person is usually awake and breathing. A cardiac arrest is an electrical problem – the heart stops beating effectively and the person becomes unresponsive and stops breathing. A heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest, but not every cardiac arrest is caused by a heart attack. If someone is unresponsive and not breathing normally, call emergency services and start CPR immediately.</p>

    <section id="prevention">
      <h2>Risk factors &amp; prevention</h2>
      <p>Some risk factors for heart attack, such as age and family history, cannot be changed. However, many risks can be reduced through lifestyle changes. According to NHS guidance, the most effective way to prevent a heart attack is to adopt healthy habits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat a healthy, balanced diet low in saturated fat and high in fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and oily fish</li>
        <li>Do not smoke</li>
        <li>Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol at healthy levels</li>
        <li>Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active</li>
        <li>Limit alcohol intake within recommended guidelines</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have existing conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes, work with your healthcare provider to manage them. Never start or stop any medication without professional advice.</p>
